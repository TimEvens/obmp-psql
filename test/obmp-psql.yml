  # In minutes; The maximum age between received collector heartbeats.
  #     The collector sends heatbeat messages every interval.  This
  #     is how the collector is detected as being up or down.  This max

  # Number of writer threads per processing type.
  #     The number of threads and psql connections are
  #     [types * writer_max_threads_per_type]. Each writer makes
  #     a connection to psql in order to execute SQL statements in parallel.
  #     The number of threads are auto-scaled up and down based on partition
  #     load.  If there is high load, additional threads will be added, up
  #     to the writer_max_threads_per_type.

  #  Following types are implemented.

  # Number of consecutive times the writer queue (per type) can sustain over
  #    the high threshold mark.  If queue is above threshold for a consecutive

  #    the writer type, providing it isn't already at max threads (per type).
  writer_allowed_over_queue_times: 2

  # Number of seconds the writer needs to sustain below the low queue threshold mark
  #     in order to trigger scaling back the number of threads in use.  Only one thread
  #     is scaled back a time.  It can take
  #     [writer_seconds_thread_scale_back * writer_max_threads_per_type - 1] time to scale
  #     back to one 1 (per type).
  writer_seconds_thread_scale_back: 4800

  # Number of seconds between rebalacing of writer threads
  #    Rebalance will drain writer queues at this interval if at least one writer is above threshold

  # By default AS Path indexing is enabled.  This can be very resource intensive to psql
  #    and disk.   You can disable updating the psql 'as_path_analysis' table if
  #    this analysis is not needed/used.  Disabling this will effect the gen_asn_stats table,
  #    which will also effect anything that uses that table.
